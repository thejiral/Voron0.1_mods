# Voron0.1_mods

Modified bottom blinds for Voron 0.1

I created the honeycomb net of the panels with Prusa slicer via infill options. The ready to print models can be be found in the 3mf file. 
Alternatively the raw component stl files are included in the zip file as well. 

The modified foot is needed for mounting panel 3. Insert 2 heat inserts (same as in the Voron 0.1 BOM). 
Panels of type 1 and 2 are mounted the same way as the original blinds but do feature throughholes for the hex key. Panel 3 is mounted with 2 M3 6mm button head screws to the rear foot right modified. 


2x Panel 1 (front panel, right side panel)

1x Panel 2 (left side panel)

1x Panel 3 (back side panel)

1x Modified Rear foot right side
